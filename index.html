		<h2>About Me:</h2>
		<p>
		My hometown is Solon, a small town located about 20 minutes north of Iowa City. After 
		moving to Solon from Iowa City when I was younger, I spent most of my time growing up 
		in the country about 5 miles outside of Solon. In high school I played basketball and
		 religiously followed the Hawkeyes. There was only one choice for college when it came
		 time to choose, right or wrong, Iowa was the only school I applied to. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I started at Iowa as an Industrial Engineering major, however learned quickly that 
		it was not what I wanted to do for a profession. Eventually I was admitted to Tippie
		and am planning on graduating in May, 2014 with a degree in MIS and a minor in 
		Sports Studies. I am unsure where I want to work after graduation but am looking
		at: Iowa, Chicago, and the Denver/Northern Colorado area.
